# Monster Eyes 2040

Based on https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/tree/main/M4_Eyes this is porting the Monster Eyes code to run on RP2040 based chips.

There are many support libraries required for this code to run and some of those also did not support the RP2040. I will try to reference which ones changed and point out and include what needs to be done in case the changes are not included upstream (and in many cases until I can polish it, for good reason).

This is a work in progress!
